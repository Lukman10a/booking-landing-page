# Front-End Development of a Responsive Website Homepage

This repository contains the code for a fully functional and responsive website homepage, created by [Your Name] as part of the second stage of the hiring process for the position of Front-end Developer.

The code is based on the Figma design linked below, and is written in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and ReactJS. The homepage is fully responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes.

## Requirements

* **Figma Design:** The Figma design for the homepage can be found at [Figma Design Link](https://www.figma.com/file/8xpE4RJMNkdCC19Z1QsNqc/Untitled?type=design&node-id=1%3A98&mode=design&t=tsKOvrD154ETwsoC-1).
* **Responsive Design:** The homepage is fully responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes. This was achieved by using a laptop-first approach and by using media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
* **HTML/CSS:** The code is written in clean, semantic HTML and CSS. Appropriate classes and IDs are used for styling, and the code is easy to maintain and understand.
* **Images and Assets:** Placeholder images and assets are used throughout the code. If the Figma design includes custom icons or graphics, these have been replaced with high-quality, responsive images.
* **Navigation Menu:** A responsive navigation menu is implemented that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. This ensures that the navigation is always accessible, regardless of the device being used.
* **Animations:** Subtle animations are added to enhance the user experience. These animations are used to create a more engaging and visually appealing website.
* **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** The code is tested in Chrome and Firefox and is compatible with all major web browsers.
